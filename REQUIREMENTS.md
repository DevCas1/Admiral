List of actions the bot must be able to do

## Hard requirements

- Connect to discord
- Receive commands via discord messages in a specific channel in order for all commands to be publicly seen.
- Must be able to start/stop/restart/status services using `systemctl` commands through `bash`
- Change discord channel name to represent the change on game server status. (ðŸŸ¢online, ðŸ”´offline)
- Detect game server status on boot and update discord accordingly
- Must run as a service and start @ boot

## Soft requirements

- Detect when server has a restart pending and automatically update _all_ game servers to "ðŸŸ¡restarting" status.
- Check for new game server versions and update discord status to "ðŸ”µneeds updating".
- Update servers using discord command (scripts are already in place, they just need to be called when there's an update)
- Periodically run a `systemctl status [GAME]` on all servers to make sure the status is correctly reflected on discord.

## Nice to have

- Some servers have an open socket for stdin so being able to send direct commands to the server through discord could be useful. (Example: `@bot stdin terraria save`).
